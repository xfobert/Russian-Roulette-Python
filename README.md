# Russian-Roulette-Python

RUSSIAN ROULETTE game in Python. Based in Orange Roulette's system.

There are three options in the game!

1: SHOOT YOURSELF

    As the name indicates, you put the gun to your head and pray the bullet is not in the chamber.

2: SPIN THE CYLINDER

    Spins the cylinder, thus randomizing the position of the bullet in the chamber.

3: SHOOT YOUR OPPONENT

    You shoot the other player, but there is a twist! If the other player survives… you will have to shoot yourself.

Every round, each player gets to choose the way they want to take their chances.

Once the game ends, you will have to rewrite it to play again.
